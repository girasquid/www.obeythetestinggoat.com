My beloved publisher, O'Reilly, don't understand how important the
testing Goat is to the Python Testing community.  They want to put
a snake on the cover!

Let's help them understand how important the Goat is to the Python
testing community!

Share your pictures, emotional experiences, goat moments...  Every
comment counts as a signature on this virtual petition.

With your help we can have an O'Reilly book about testing with a 
goat on the cover!
