* My [TDD / Django Tutorial at PyCon 2013](http://pyvideo.org/video/1657/fully-test-driven-web-development-with-django-and)

* [TDD London Style with Ruby RSpec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdNnN5yTIeM) by Gary Bernhardt. Ruby, sacrilege obviously, but RSpec is pretty cool, Gary's typing has to be seen to be believed, and if "London Style" is actually a think I guess I have to link to it!

* Another PyCon talk on [how to get started with automated testing](http://pyvideo.org/video/1674/getting-started-with-automated-testing)

* Selenium are really pushing the boundaries -- you can now [use Selenium to test mobile apps](http://pyvideo.org/video/1699/mobile-application-testing-with-python-and-seleni) -- and not just the mobile browsers, native apps too.

* [How can I motivate coworkers to write unit tests?](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/how-can-i-motivate-coworkers-to-write-unit-tests/) (thanks Jason)

* [Flipping the bit](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/01/11/Flipping-the-Bit.html) "What if you were on the Starship Enterprise and the warp coil was seconds away from an anti-matter explosion and all you needed to do was invert one IF statement to save the ship. Would you use TDD for that?: Yes."

* Want to get really chin-strokey about testing?  Read [Mocks aren't stubs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html), and form some strong opinions about
what the One True Way should be...
