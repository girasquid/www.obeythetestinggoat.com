I feel incredibly lucky to be writing this book, and have the standard amounts of
impostor syndrome. I've only actually been doing TDD for a couple of years, and I've
only been a professional programmer for about 3 years.  But I feel I've learned a lot,
and I enjoy sharing the knowledge.

But I need your help!  If you're a beginner, let me know if the books works well for
you as a lerning tool.  If you're an experienced TDD-er, read my draft, and let me
know what you think: am I presenting TDD in the right way?  What would you do
differently?  Is there anything you think I'm missing?

There are two ways you can read this book:

* [Buy it now](http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7079286-11260198?url=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.oreilly.com%2Fproduct%2F0636920029533.do%3Fcmp%3Daf-code-book-product_cj_9781449367794_%7BPID%7D&cjsku=0636920029533)
from O'Reilly.  Obviously this would be my favourite option.

O'Reilly are great, they have DRM-free versions you can download in all sorts
of formats (MOBI/epub/pdf), and you'll get updates automatically every few
weeks.  You can also read it at <a

account there.


* [Read it online for free](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754) via O'Reilly' Chimera.

Use that if you want to try before you buy, or if you're a peniless student... I 
do hope that, if you enjoy it, or if you get a job, you'll consider buying a
copy... if not for yourself, then perhaps for a friend!
