        I'm writing a book all about TDD and Web programming.
        <a href="/pages/book.html">Read the draft</a> and let me
        know what you think!

  <p>
  My beloved publisher, O'Reilly, doesn't understand how important the
  testing Goat is to the Python Testing community.  They want to put
  a snake on the cover.
  <a href="/pages/save-the-testing-goat-campaign.html">Help them understand</a> how
  much you love the Goat, sign the petition, share your goat experiences and
  pictures...

    This is my <a href="http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com">old TDD tutorial</a>,
    which follows along with the official Django tutorial, but with full TDD.  It
    badly needs updating. Read the book instead!
