        I'm writing a book all about TDD and Web programming.
        <a href="/pages/book.html">Read the draft</a> and let me
        know what you think!

  <p>
  My beloved publisher, O'Reilly, has suggested a snake as the cover
  animal. Let's have the Testing Goat instead! 
  <a href="/pages/save-the-testing-goat-campaign.html">Submit your comments here</a>
  and help them understand how important the Goat is to the 
  Python Testing community.

    <p>
    This is my <a href="http://www.tdd-django-tutorial.com">old TDD tutorial</a>,
    which follows along with the official Django tutorial, but with full TDD.  It
    badly needs updating. Read the book instead!
